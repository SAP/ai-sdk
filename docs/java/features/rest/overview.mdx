## OpenAPI Based Type-Safe Client for RESTful Services in Java

The SAP Cloud SDK for Java is prepared to generate type-safe clients using [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) to conveniently work with various OpenAPI based services available at [SAP API Hub](https://api.sap.com/).

### Pregenerated Type-Safe OpenAPI Client

We ship pre-generated type-safe REST API clients as modules in collaboration with popular SAP services available on SAP Business Technology Platform and beyond.

Depending on the scope modules could be available only internally within SAP or publicly released.
The [SAP Workflow service API](clients/scp-workflow-rest-api) is an example of a publicly released API module.

In case you need information on REST or other services shipped only internally, please, approach us directly via standard communication channels.

## Why Using SAP Cloud SDK for Java With OpenAPI Services?

- We take care of various complexities around developing of applications and extensions on SAP Business Technology Platform.
- You'll get convenience abstractions for Destinations, Authentication, Service bindings, CSRF and ETag tokens, Headers, and much more.
- We hide complexities of cloud development making many tasks ridiculously easy.
- You're getting best in class support from the SAP Cloud SDK development team
- We take care of change management by continuously updating, integrating, and shipping the latest version of services that we release.
