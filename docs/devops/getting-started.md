## DevOps ##
Continuous integration and delivery are pillars for contemporary application development. DevOps is a first class
citizen in SAP Cloud SDK and shipped as best practice with all generated project templates.

### CI/CD for SAP Cloud SDK ###

All the pipeline and action configuration for Cloud SDK is based on open sourced SAP library dubbed [Project
Piper](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/guidedtour/ ).

[Please, check official documentation for more details.](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/)
