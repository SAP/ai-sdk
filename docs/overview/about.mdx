## Introduction

The SAP Cloud SDK is a versatile set of libraries and tools for developers to easily build applications in a cloud native way and host them on SAP Cloud Platform or other runtimes.

The SAP Cloud SDK is available for Java, and JavaScript/Typescript ecosystems providing the following capabilities:

- A set of pre-generated type-safe clients for various SAP published OData and REST services for convenient consumption and bullet-proof developer experience.
- Robust connectivity abstractions for SAP Cloud Platform for convenient management of Destinations, Authentication, Multi-tenancy, CSRF, E-tags and more.
- A tailor-made type-safe client code generator for OData services which is seamlessly integrated with other SDK value-adds.
- A type-safe client code generator for REST services that wraps open source generator with custom code templates to make it deeply integrated with other SDK features.
- An easy to use CLI with code scaffolding capabilities.
- A pre-configured CI/CD pipeline to set you on the best DevOps practices from the get going.
- Modular design and high-level of extensibility
- Advanced cloud-native development patterns like resilience, caching, inherent multi-tenancy, etc.
- Support in Business Application Strudio IDE

The SAP Cloud SDK is well-integrated with other SAP products and services like Cloud Application Programming model also known as CAP, S/4HANA Cloud, and On-Premise ERPs, SAP API Business Hub, SuccessFactors, C4C, Feildglass, Concur, Ariba, SAP Cloud Platform, Deploy with Confidence, and, thanks to code generator capabilities, compatible almost with any other product which can be the one you develop.

It gives a lot of advantages and instant access to SAP Cloud ecosystem for developers building Apps or Extensions for SAP products or integrating them with other products and solutions.

For more details check out our Feature matrix and Getting Started guides for both SDKs.

### Open Source

The SAP Cloud SDK actively works in the direction of open-sourcing most of its code. We endorse best open standards and
technologies to simplify the developer's life and stay ahead of the curve. It's almost impossible to develop such a product
as a closed source only. As of today we already open sourced SDK for [JavaScript](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js) and
[Continuous delivery toolkit](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline )  to raise transparency, allow developers easily access our source code,
integrate it in their Apps, and contribute back into SDK to make it better.

On the other hand, we're remaining main contributors to every SDK component and continue actively developing them to
ensure the highest quality and seamless integration with other SAP solutions.
