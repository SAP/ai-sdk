## Should I update?
We highly recommend regularly updating to the latest SDK version. It will help you:

- ensure access to the latest Cloud SDK features
- keep up with the latest changes in SAP Cloud Platform
- update client libraries giving access to latest SAP services on SAP Cloud Platform and S4/HANA
- protect yourself from bugs and breaking changes in the future
