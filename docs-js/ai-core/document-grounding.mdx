:::warning
This package is still in **beta** and is subject to breaking changes. Use it with caution.
:::

The `@sap-ai-sdk/document-grounding` package incorporates generative AI document grounding capabilities into your AI activities in SAP AI Core and SAP AI Launchpad.

## Installation

```
$ npm install @sap-ai-sdk/document-grounding
```

## Usage

The examples below demonstrate the usage of the most commonly used APIs in SAP AI Core document grounding service.
In addition to the examples below, you can find more **sample code** [here](https://github.com/SAP/ai-sdk-js/blob/main/sample-code/src/document-grounding.ts).

:::tip
If you define a custom resource group, ensure that it has the label `document-grounding: true` in order to use the document grounding service.
This label can be set in SAP AI Launchpad while creating the resource group.
Alternatively, create a resource group via AI API by referring to the [Creating a Resource Group for Grounding](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/create-resource-group-for-ai-data-management?locale=en-US) guide.

### Create a Collection

```ts
const response = await VectorApi.createCollection(
  {
    title: 'my-collection-title',
    embeddingConfig: {
      modelName: 'text-embedding-3-small'
    },
    metadata: []
  },
  {
    'AI-Resource-Group': 'default'
  }
).executeRaw();

const collectionId = (response.headers.location as string).split('/').at(-2);
```

### Create a Document

```ts
const response: DocumentsListResponse = await VectorApi.createDocuments(
  collectionId,
  {
    documents: [
      {
        metadata: [],
        chunks: [
          {
            content:
              'SAP Cloud SDK for AI is the official Software Development Kit (SDK) for SAP AI Core, SAP Generative AI Hub, and Orchestration Service.',
            metadata: []
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    'AI-Resource-Group': 'default'
  }
).execute();
```

### Custom Destination

When calling the `execute()` method, it is possible to provide a custom destination.
For example, when querying deployments targeting a destination with the name `my-destination`, the following code can be used:

```ts
const response = await VectorApi.deleteCollectionById(collectionId, {
  'AI-Resource-Group': 'default'
}).execute({
  destinationName: 'my-destination'
});
```

By default, the fetched destination is cached.
To disable caching, set the `useCache` parameter to `false` together with the `destinationName` parameter.

For more information about configuring a destination, refer to the [Using a Destination](connecting-to-ai-core#using-a-destination) section.
