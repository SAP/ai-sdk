The `@sap-ai-sdk/langchain` packages provides `OrchestrationClient` client for LangChain integration with orchestration service.

## Client Initialization

The client reuses the orchestration client from `@sap-ai-sdk/orchestration` and implements the [LangChain's interface](https://js.langchain.com/docs/introduction).
Therefore, the client initialization combines the configuration of the orchestration client and LangChain options.

Similar to the orchestration client, the `OrchestrationClient` LangChain client can be initialized with an orchestration configuration.
Refer to [Orchestration Chat Completion](../orchestration/chat-completion) for more information about the configuration.

```ts
import { OrchestrationClient } from '@sap-ai-sdk/langchain';

const config: OrchestrationModuleConfig = {
  llm: {
    model_name: 'gpt-4o'
  },
  templating: {
    template: [
      { role: 'user', content: 'Give me a long introduction of {{?subject}}' }
    ]
  }
};
const client = new OrchestrationClient(config);
```

Optionally, you can also specify LangChain options, resource group in deployment config, and a custom destination.

### Custom Destination

When initialize the client, it is possible to provide a custom destination for your SAP AI Core instance.

```ts
const client = new OrchestrationClient(
  orchestrationConfig,
  langchainOptions,
  deploymentConfig,
  { destinationName: 'my-destination' }
);
```

By default, the fetched destination is cached.
To disable caching, set the `useCache` parameter to `false` together with the `destinationName` parameter.

For more information about configuring a destination, refer to the [Using a Destination](connecting-to-ai-core#using-a-destination) section.

## Chat Completion

Pass a message history and, in most cases, input parameters for the orchestration templating module.

```ts
const systemMessage = new SystemMessage('Be a helpful assisstant!');
const history = [systemMessage];
const response = await client.invoke(history, {
  inputParams: { subject: 'Paris' }
});
```

## Resilience

Use LangChain options such as `maxRetries` and `timeout` to provide resilience.

### Retry

By default, LangChain client retries up to six times with exponential delay.
To modify this behavior, set the `maxRetries` option during the client initialization.

```ts
const client = new OrchestrationClient(orchestrationConfig, {
  maxRetries: 0
});
```

If the error is caused by input content filtering, the client will throw immediately without retrying.

### Timeout

By default, no timeout is set in the client.
To limit the maximum duration for the entire request including retries, specify a timeout in milliseconds when calling the `invoke` method.

```ts
const response = await client.invoke(messageHistory, { timeout: 10000 });
```

## Limitations

Currently unsupported features are:

- Streaming
- Tool Calling
