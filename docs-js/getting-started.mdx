### What You'll Build

In this quickstart, you'll use the OpenAI GPT-4o model through the [Orchestration Service of AI Core](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/orchestration) for generating text.
The application will send a prompt to the AI model and display the generated response.

### Prerequisites

This quickstart assumes you are using the `default` resource group of your AI Core instance.
If you want or need to [use a different resource group](orchestration/chat-completion#create-a-client), please ensure that resource group has an [orchestration deployment](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/create-deployment-for-orchestration) available.

### Add the SAP Cloud SDK for AI as a Dependency

Install `@sap-ai-sdk/orchestration` package with your package manager, e.g., npm.

```bash
npm install @sap-ai-sdk/orchestration
```

### Use the Orchestration API

Initialize an orchestration client with an LLM model and a prompt template.

```ts
import { OrchestrationClient } from '@sap-ai-sdk/orchestration';

const orchestrationClient = new OrchestrationClient({
  llm: {
    model_name: 'gpt-4o'
  },
  templating: {
    template: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Answer the question: {{?question}}' }]
  }
});
```

Next, we send a chat completion request with a value defined for the input parameter `question`.
The value replaces the `{{?question}}` placeholder in the template.

```ts
const response = await orchestrationClient.chatCompletion({
  inputParams: {
    question: 'Why is the phrase "Hello world!" so famous?'
  }
});
console.log(response.getContent());
```

Use `getContent()` method to get the generated text.

### Run the Application Locally

Create a `.env` file with the following content to define the `AICORE_SERVICE_KEY` environment variable storing the service key of your AI Core service instance.

```txt
AICORE_SERVICE_KEY='{
  "clientid": "...",
  ...
}'
```

Load the `.env` file by using [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) or running `node --env-file=.env ...`.
