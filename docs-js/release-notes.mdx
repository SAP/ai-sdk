### New Features

- [langchain] Support `bindTools()` method in Orchestration LangChain client. (4474313)

### Improvements

- [core] Add `o3`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4.1-nano`, `o4-mini` and `mistralai--mistral-small-instruct` to available model list. (5307dd0)

## 1.14.0 - May 28, 2025

### Compatibility Notes

- [orchestration] Since `ChatMessage` type is now one of the many specific types such as `SystemChatMessage` and `UserChatMessage` with predefined roles in the orchestration service specification, always define type when creating objects of type `OrchestrationModuleConfig` and `TemplatingModuleConfig` to avoid `role` being any string. (84cfa07)
