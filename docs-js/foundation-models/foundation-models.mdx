The `@sap-ai-sdk/foundation-models` package incorporates generative AI foundation models into your AI activities in SAP AI Core and SAP AI Launchpad.

## Installation

```
$ npm install @sap-ai-sdk/foundation-models
```

## Prerequisites

Ensure a model is deployed and available.
Use the [`DeploymentApi`](ai-api#create-a-deployment) from `@sap-ai-sdk/ai-api` [to deploy a model](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/create-deployment-for-generative-ai-model-in-sap-ai-core).
Alternatively, you can create deployment using the [SAP AI Launchpad](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/generative-ai-hub/activate-generative-ai-hub-for-sap-ai-launchpad?locale=en-US&q=launchpad).
Deployment can be set up for each model and model version, as well as a resource group.
Once the deployment is complete, verify that it can be accessed via the `deploymentUrl`.

## Client Initialization

Initialize a client with the model name. 
If model version is not specified, it is set to `latest`.

The current available clients are:
    - `AzureOpenAiChatClient`
    - `AzureOpenAiEmbeddingClient`

Take the `AzureOpenAiChatClient` as an example, use the following code to initialize a client:

```ts
import { AzureOpenAiChatClient } from '@sap-ai-sdk/foundation-models';

const client = new AzureOpenAiChatClient('gpt-4o');
```

The deployment ID will be implicitly fetched from the `default` resource group.
By default, the deployment information is cached for five minutes, including deployment ID, model name, and model version.

When using other resource groups, you can specify the `resourceGroup` parameter.

```ts
const client = new AzureOpenAiChatClient({
  modelName: 'gpt-4o',
  // modelVersion: '2024-08-06', // optional
  resourceGroup: 'my-resource-group'
});
```

Alternatively, you can also provide a deployment ID instead of model name (and model version).

```ts
const client = new AzureOpenAiChatClient({
  // resourceGroup: 'my-resource-group', // optional
  deploymentId: 'd1234'
});
```

:::tip
When initializaing a client for using a foundation model, it is equivalent to provide
    - a combination of model name and model version
    - or deployment ID

to identify a model within a [Resource Group](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/resource-groups?q=resource+group).
If multiple deployments were created with the same model name and version, the first deployment will be used.
:::

### Custom Destination

When initializing a client, it is possible to provide a custom destination.
For example, when initializing an `AzureOpenAiChatClient` targeting a destination with the name `my-destination`, the following code can be used:

```ts
const client = await new AzureOpenAiChatClient('gpt-4o', {
  destinationName: 'my-destination'
});
```

By default, the fetched destination is cached.
To disable caching, set the `useCache` parameter to `false` together with the `destinationName` parameter.

For more information about configuring a destination, refer to the [Using a Destination](connecting-to-ai-core#using-a-destination) section.

## Custom Request Configuration

Set custom request configuration in the `requestConfig` parameter when calling the `run()` method of a client.

```ts
const response = await client.run(
  {
    ...
  },
  {
    headers: {
      'x-custom-header': 'custom-value'
      // Add more headers here
    },
    params: {
      // Add more parameters here
    }
    // Add more request configuration here
  }
);
```

This can be useful, e.g., to overwrite the API version of Azure OpenAI by defining the `api-version` parameter in the `params` object.

```ts
{ 
  params: { 
    'api-version': 'AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION' 
  }
}
```
