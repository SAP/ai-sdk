Initialize the `AzureOpenAiEmbeddingClient` by following the instructions in the [Client Initialization](../../foundation-models#client-initialization) section.

Currently, the client sends request with Azure OpenAI API version `2024-10-21`.
We are continuously updating the client to match the latest API specification.
You can overwrite the API version by setting the `api-version` parameter in the `CustomRequestConfig` object.
Refer to the [Custom Request Configuration](../../foundation-models#custom-request-configuration) section for more details.

## Making Requests

```ts
const response = await client.run({
  input: 'AI is fascinating'
});
const embedding = response.getEmbedding();
```
