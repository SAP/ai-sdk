### Which library should I use for AI integration in the SAP ecosystem? I see an npm package `CAP LLM Plugin`.

Use the **SAP Cloud SDK for AI**, the official Software Development Kit (SDK) for **SAP AI Core**, **SAP Generative AI Hub**, and **Orchestration Service**.
The SAP Cloud SDK for AI is fully aligned with the SAP AI Core roadmap, ensuring you always have access to the latest features and the newest LLMs.

The `CAP LLM Plugin` includes the following disclaimer:

> This project is provided "as-is" with no expectation for major changes or support.

As a result, new models (e.g., `gpt-4.1`, `gemini-2.0`, `anthropic--claude-3.7`, `mistralai`, and `deepseek`) and upcoming features of SAP AI Core will not be supported.

Only use the `CAP LLM Plugin` for special use cases or if you are an existing user, as the plugin cannot provide support for other use-cases and will stay with a limited scope and feature set.
