### Which library should I use for AI integration in SAP ecosystem? I see an npm package `CAP LLM Plugin`.

Use SAP Cloud SDK for AI, which is the only official Software Development Kit (SDK) for **SAP AI Core**, **SAP Generative AI Hub**, and **Orchestration Service**.
The SAP Cloud SDK for AI is fully aligned with the road map of the SAP AI Core, so you can always catch up the latest features and adopt the newest LLMs.

The CAP LLM Plugin has the following statements:
> This project is provided "as-is" with no expectation for major changes or support.

Therefore, new models (e.g., `gpt-4.1`, `gemini-2.0`, `anthropic--claude-3.7`, `mistralai` and `deepseek`) and new features of the AI core will not be available.
Only use the Plugin for special use cases and for existing users.

This statement is well aligned with the Plugin team.
