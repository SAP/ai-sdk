### Which library should I use for AI integration in the SAP ecosystem? I see an npm package `CAP LLM Plugin`.

Use the **SAP Cloud SDK for AI**, the official Software Development Kit (SDK) for **SAP AI Core**, **SAP Generative AI Hub**, and **Orchestration Service**.

The SAP Cloud SDK for AI is fully aligned with the SAP AI Core roadmap, ensuring you always have access to the latest features and the newest LLMs.

Only use the `CAP LLM Plugin` for special use cases or if you are an existing user, as the plugin cannot provide support for other use-cases and will stay with a limited scope and feature set.
