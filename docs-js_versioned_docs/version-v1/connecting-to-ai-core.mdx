The SAP Cloud SDK for AI uses the [Destination concept of the SAP Cloud SDK](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/js/features/connectivity/destinations) to connect to AI Core.
This allows for a seamless integration in SAP BTP and offers a wide variety of managing the credentials for the connection.

## Using a Service Binding

By default, the SAP Cloud SDK for AI will look for an `aicore` service binding in the environment of the application.

When running on SAP BTP, [create an instance of the AI Core service](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/create-service-instance) and bind it to your application.

- In Cloud Foundry, it's accessed from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
- In Kubernetes / Kyma environments, you have to mount the service binding as a secret instead, for more information refer to [this documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/xsenv#usage-in-kubernetes).

If no service binding is found and no destination is explicitly provided, the SDK throws an exception:

```txt
Could not find service credentials for AI Core. Please check the service binding.
```

To run the code outside of SAP BTP (e.g., locally), provide the necessary credentials manually.

### Providing a Service Binding Locally

For local development, you can provide the service credentials locally in several ways.

#### Using CAP Hybrid Testing

When developing a [CAP application](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/), you can use the [hybrid testing](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/advanced/hybrid-testing#services-on-cloud-foundry) approach.
The following command will bind the credential of your AI Core service instance:

```bash
cds bind -2 AICORE_INSTANCE_NAME
```

Then run the application with the hybrid profile:

```bash
cds-tsx watch --profile hybrid
```

#### Using the `AICORE_SERVICE_KEY` Environment Variable

You can provide the service credential in the `AICORE_SERVICE_KEY` environment variable.
SAP Cloud SDK for AI will read it through `process.env.AICORE_SERVICE_KEY` variable.

[Create a service key](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/create-service-key) for your AI Core service instance and copy the resulting JSON object.

Next, set the environment variable `AICORE_SERVICE_KEY`, e.g., by creating a `.env` file with the following content:

```txt
AICORE_SERVICE_KEY='{
    "clientid": "...",
    ...
}'
```

Load the `.env` file by using [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) or running `node --env-file=.env ...`.

For NextJS, see [this documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables).

## Using a Destination

### Using the SAP BTP Destination Service

You can define a destination in the SAP BTP Destination Service and use that to connect to SAP AI Core.

<details>
<summary>How to create a Destination in the SAP BTP Cockpit</summary>

1. [Create a service key for your AI Core service instance](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/create-service-key).

2. Create a new Destination in the SAP BTP Cockpit with the following properties:

   - **Name**: `my-aicore`
   - **Type**: `HTTP`
   - **URL**: `[serviceurls.AI_API_URL]`
   - **Proxy Type**: `Internet`
   - **Authentication**: `OAuth2ClientCredentials`
   - **Client ID**: `[clientid]`
   - **Client Secret**: `[clientsecret]`
   - **Token Service URL Type**: `Dedicated`
   - **Token Service URL**: `[url]/oauth/token`

   Fill in the values for URL, client ID, client secret, and token service URL from the service key JSON.
   Make sure to add `/oauth/token` in the token service URL.

</details>

:::tip
If you are using CAP, you can again use Hybrid Testing to bind the destination service to your application when running **locally**.
:::

Ensure you have created an instance of the SAP BTP Destination Service and bound it to your application.

By default, the fetched destination is cached.
Check the [Cache Expiration](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/js/features/connectivity/destination-cache#cache-expiration) section of the SAP Cloud SDK documentation for more details.

This destination can be used later when initializing a client or calling the `execute()` method.

### Creating a Custom Destination

You can register a destination for AI Core programmatically.
For more details, refer to the [Register Destination](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/js/features/connectivity/destinations#register-destination) section of the SAP Cloud SDK documentation.
